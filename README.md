Question 4

Degree Centrality
Degree centrality assigns an importance score based simply on the number of links held by each node.

Betweenness centrality
Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.

Closeness centrality
Closeness centrality scores each node based on their ‘closeness’ to all other nodes in the network.

Eigen vector Centrality
Like degree centrality, EigenCentrality measures a node’s influence based on the number of links it has to other nodes in the network. EigenCentrality then goes a step further by also taking into account how well connected a node is, and how many links their connections have, and so on through the network.
