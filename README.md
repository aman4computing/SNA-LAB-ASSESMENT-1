<b>Question 4</b>



<b>Degree Centrality</b>

Degree centrality assigns an importance score based simply on the number of links held by each node.

<b>Betweenness centrality</b>

Betweenness centrality measures the number of times a node lies on the shortest path between other nodes.

<b>Closeness centrality</b>

Closeness centrality scores each node based on their ‘closeness’ to all other nodes in the network.

<b>Eigen vector Centrality</b>

Like degree centrality, EigenCentrality measures a node’s influence based on the number of links it has to other nodes in the network. EigenCentrality then goes a step further by also taking into account how well connected a node is, and how many links their connections have, and so on through the network.
